# Loop statements


## Task 1 
For a positive integer _n_ calculate the _result_ value, which is equal to the sum of the odd numbers in _n_
 
Example 

```
n = 1234   result = 4 (1 + 3)

n = 246    result = 0  
```
## Task 2
For a positive integer _n_ calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the “1” in the binary representation of _n_.  

Example 

```
n = 14(decimal) = 1110(binary)       result =  3 

n = 128(decimal) = 1000 0000(binary) result  =  1 
```
## Task 3
For a positive integer _n_, calculate the result value equal to the sum of the first _n_ Fibonacci numbers
Note: Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each next number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (F0=0, F1=F2=1, then F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>2)  

Example 

```
n = 8    result = 33 

n = 11   result = 143 
```
