# Condition statements


## Task 1 
For a given integer _n_ calculate the value which is equal to: 
1. squared number, if its value is strictly positive; 
1. modulus of a number, if its value is strictly negative; 
1. zero, if the integer n is zero.
 
Example 

```
n = 4     result =  16 
n = -5    result =  5 
n = 0     result = 0 
```
## Task 2
Find the maximum integer, that can be obtained by numbers of an arbitrary three-digit positive integer _n_ permutation (100<=n<=999). 

Example 

```
n = 165   result =  651 
```
